# B-NN — One-line statement of the task

What is wrong today and why it is worth fixing. One paragraph, with facts from the code rather
than generalities: which file, which behaviour, what the user sees.

- **The decision and its reason.** Not "do X" but "do X because Y". In six months the value of
  this item is the reason; the implementation is visible in the diff.
- The alternative that was rejected, and why it is worse.
- What this item deliberately does **not** cover.

- AC: an observable result. "The owner does A and sees B", not "A is implemented".
- Anchors: paths to the files this will touch (`repo/path/File.ext`).
